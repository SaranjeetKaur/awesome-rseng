## Overview

If you are interested in research software engineering, and especially looking to
help with research software, this is a small, manually curated list of GitHub
organizations that have primarily this focus. The projects are organized by domain,
and then subtopics. Please feel free to suggest a new project, or update the organization.

## Astrophysics

 - [LSST](https://github.com/lsst) the legacy survey of space and time
 - [LSST Camera Data Handling](https://github.com/lsst-camera-dh/)

## Genomics

 - [The ENCODE Data Consortium](https://github.com/encode-dcc) or "Encode DCC" serving the Encode Data Portal.

## Geoscience

 - [Pangeo](https://github.com/pangeo-data): A community effort for big data geoscience

## High Performance Computing

 - [CEED](https://github.com/CEED): ECP Co-Design Center for Efficient Exascale Discretizations (CEED)
 - [spack](https://github.com/spack/) a flexible package manager for multiple versions, configurations, and compilers

## Institutions

### Academic Groups

- [Imperial College London](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/)

### Academic Labs

 - [Nolan Lab](https://github.com/nolanlab) at Stanford University focuses on signaling in the immune system and study of oncogenic process.
 - [Poldrack Lab](https://github.com/poldracklab) at Stanford University focuses on standard
   workflows for processing structural and functional neuroimaging (MRI) data.

### National Labs
