This is a documentation feature request: To facilitate optimal use in containerized environments, it would be helpful to have an example of using spack with (say) a docker ubuntu image, including recommendations of how to maximally clean up after package installs to minimize space usage. This is implicit in the current documentation, but a specific section with examples would establish best practices.
