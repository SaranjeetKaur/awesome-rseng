We have a pretty one-size-fits-all error when we can't determine the file type:

```Shell
$ head -c 1000 /dev/zero > test.nii.gz
$ python -c "import nibabel as nb; nb.load('test.nii.gz')"
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
  File ".../nibabel/nibabel/loadsave.py", line 55, in load
    raise ImageFileError(f'Cannot work out file type of "{filename}"')
nibabel.filebasedimages.ImageFileError: Cannot work out file type of "test.nii.gz"
```

A relatively common situation is an uncompressed NIfTI that got renamed `x.nii.gz`. It's fairly straightforward to identify data that isn't gzip or bzip2 by magic number, so we could help people out with a message like `File "test.nii.gz" is not a gzip file.`
