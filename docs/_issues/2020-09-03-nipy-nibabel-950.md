Pre-release [builds](https://travis-ci.com/github/nipy/nibabel/jobs/380411702) reveal `np.float`, `np.complex`, `np.int` are deprecated aliases to builtin `float`, `complex` and `int`.

We can switch to using the builtins directly with no consequence. It might also be worth looking at whether a more precise type (e.g. `numpy.float32` where `float` will typically be interpreted as `numpy.float64`) is appropriate in some cases.
