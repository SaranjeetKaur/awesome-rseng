Add the GALAHAD optimization library.  GALAHAD is a little unusual in that it requires a manual download, and it has a strange build system.  But it does useful optimizations, and these Spack packages do work.

Other optimization packages include NLOpt.

For now, I no longer use GALAHAD in my work.  But I recommend this gets merged anyway, because the build works, and somebody else might want it.
