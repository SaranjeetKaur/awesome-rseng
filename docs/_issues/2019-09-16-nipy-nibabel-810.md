For the 3.0+ series, we can change this idiom:

```Python
with clear_and_catch_warnings() as w:
    warnings.simplefilter('always')
    # line that is expected to produce warning
    assert_equal(len(w), 1)
    assert_true(w[0].category is <warningclass>)
```

To [`numpy.testing.assert_warns`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.testing.assert_warns.html):

```Python
with assert_warns(<warningclass>):
    # line that is expected to produce warning
```

This is generally more readable, IMO, and less prone to disruption when upstream libraries raise extra warnings. For assertions that a line does *not* raise a warning, we can keep using the old idiom, or write our own.
