I think it would be worth adding separate `make tidy` and `make style` Travis runs, similar to how MFEM does. We could possibly simplify our YAML a bit by doing this (depending upon what you see as simpler).

Also, Travis has the ability to name certain jobs, which would make it easier to read the summary page.
