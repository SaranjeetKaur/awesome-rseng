Request to mention that you can use hashes in `spack uninstall -h` and `Error: You can either:`.

### Rationale
I happened to have created multiple modules, and I hope to delete one of them, but failed like this: 
```
$ spack uninstall openmpi
==> Error: openmpi@1.10.7%gcc@4.8.5~cuda matches multiple packages:

    -- linux-centos7-x86_64 / gcc@4.8.5 -----------------------------
    26w2v3w openmpi@1.10.7%gcc ~cuda+cxx_exceptions fabrics=none ~java~legacylaunchers~memchecker~pmi schedulers=none ~sqlite3~thread_multiple+vt
    f4cgywb openmpi@1.10.7%gcc ~cuda+cxx_exceptions fabrics=none ~java~legacylaunchers~memchecker~pmi schedulers=none ~sqlite3~thread_multiple+vt
==> Error: You can either:
    a) use a more specific spec, or
    b) use `spack uninstall --all` to uninstall ALL matching specs.
```
After searching for a while, I found the solution in #2199 to use hash. Although, the problem was solved, I really think the last sentence in this [comment](https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/2199#issuecomment-265968123) should be considered again.

### Description
Sometimes newbies make mistakes to create duplicated spack modules, but there is no hint for them to use the harsh to uninstall the specific package. Thus, it could be helpful to mention that you can use hashes in `spack uninstall -h` and `Error: You can either:`
